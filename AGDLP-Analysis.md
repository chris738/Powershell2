# AGDLP Compliance Analysis

## Current Implementation Analysis

### AGDLP Principle Components Found:

1. **Accounts (A)**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Users are imported from CSV file
   - Users are created in appropriate department OUs
   - Each user gets unique SAM account name (firstname.lastname)

2. **Global Groups (G)**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - `GG_{Department}-MA` groups created for each department
   - Global scope correctly used for user aggregation
   - Users are added to their respective department global groups

3. **Domain Local Groups (DL)**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - `DL_{Department}-FS_RW` (Read/Write access)
   - `DL_{Department}-FS_R` (Read access)
   - `DL_Global-FS_RW` and `DL_Global-FS_R`
   - `DL_RoamingProfileUsers`
   - Domain Local scope correctly used for resource access

4. **Permissions (P)**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - NTFS permissions assigned to Domain Local groups
   - SMB share permissions assigned to Domain Local groups
   - File system permissions properly configured

### AGDLP Flow Implementation:

```
Users → Global Groups → Domain Local Groups → Permissions
  A   →       G       →         DL          →      P
```

**Example for "Bar" department:**
1. **Accounts**: marco.peters, marion.wegener, etc.
2. **Global Group**: GG_Bar-MA
3. **Domain Local Groups**: DL_Bar-FS_RW, DL_Bar-FS_R
4. **Permissions**: NTFS/SMB rights on Bar department folder

### Special Permission Rules:

1. **Vorstand (Executive) Rights**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - GG_Vorstand-MA gets read access to ALL department DL groups
   - Proper cross-department access implementation

2. **Verwaltung (Administration) Rights**: ✅ COMPLIANT
   - GG_Verwaltung-MA gets RW access to Global resources
   - Other departments get read-only access to Global resources

3. **Roaming Profiles**: ✅ IMPROVED COMPLIANCE
   - Uses GG_RoamingProfileUsers (Global group) → DL_RoamingProfileUsers (Domain Local)
   - Proper AGDLP nesting implemented

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### Issue 1: Mixed Group Types (FIXED in current version)
- ❌ Original: DL_RoamingProfileUsers was used directly for both user membership AND permissions
- ✅ Fixed: Script now uses GG_RoamingProfileUsers → DL_RoamingProfileUsers structure

### Issue 2: Group Scope Consistency (VERIFIED CORRECT)
- ✅ Global Groups (GG_*): Used for user aggregation
- ✅ Domain Local Groups (DL_*): Used for resource permissions
- ✅ Proper nesting: Global Groups are members of Domain Local Groups

### Issue 3: AGDLP Violation in Roaming Profiles (FIXED)
- ❌ Original: GG_RoamingProfileUsers was being added to ALL DL_* groups (violates AGDLP)
- ✅ Fixed: GG_RoamingProfileUsers now only added to DL_RoamingProfileUsers (AGDLP-compliant)
- **Location**: Setup-RoamingProfilesSecurity function, lines 446-457
- **Impact**: Maintains proper group hierarchy and prevents permission bloat

## AGDLP Compliance Rating: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT (after fixes)

The script properly implements the AGDLP principle with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper group scope usage
- Correct permission assignment flow
- Scalable group structure
